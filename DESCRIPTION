Description: The metamicrobiomeR package implements Generalized Additive Model for Location, Scale and Shape (GAMLSS) 
    with zero inflated beta (BEZI) family for analysis of microbiome relative abundance data 
    (with various options for data transformation/normalization to address compositional effects) and 
    random effect meta-analysis models for meta-analysis pooling estimates across microbiome studies.
    Random Forest model to predict microbiome age based on relative abundances of  
    shared bacterial genera with the Bangladesh data (Subramanian et al 2014), 
    comparison of multiple diversity indexes using linear/linear mixed effect models 
    and some data display/visualization are also implemented.
